This project was created for the McGill Physics Hackathon the weekend of November 5th-6th, 2022.

This is a diffraction/interference pattern simulator that uses the Huygens-Fresnel model of light propagation. It simulates diffracted light through an occluder and the subsequent interference pattern caused by the wave like behaviour of light (or electrons or any wave behaviour).

To run this project make sure you have the required libraries from `requirements.txt` then run `wave_simulation.py`, and have fun with it!
